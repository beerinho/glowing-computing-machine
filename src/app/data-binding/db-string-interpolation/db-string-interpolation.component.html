<h2>String interpolation</h2>
<p>{{ "This" }} is an {{ variableName }} of {{ getString() }}</p>
<p>
  You can use strings (numbers will be returned as a string), variables from the
  component file, or functions that return a string.
</p>
<p>
  String interpolation is good when you want to display something in the DOM, in
  mist other cases you should use another method.
